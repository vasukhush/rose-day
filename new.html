          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          On this beautiful day of roses <br />I just wanted to
          take a moment to express my undying love for
          you. You are the sunshine in my life that
          brightens up even the gloomiest of days. Every
          time I look into your eyes, I see a world full of
          love and happiness.
          Just like the rose, you have a certain charm that
          attracts me towards you. Your smile, your touch,
          your voice-everything about you is just perfect.You are the
          most precious gem in my life, and I promise to
          love you forever no matter what. I hope and pray that our unimaginable future love
          blossoms just like the roses and never fades
          away.
          Happy Rose Day, Mah Apsara.
